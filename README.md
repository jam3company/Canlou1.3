# Canlou-1.3

Canlou is a mobile app. It was designed with the purpose of changing the world by teaching how to recycle properly. By using AI recognition, users just have to take a picture of the item they want to recycle and the app will tell them in which trash bin they have to toss it. By doing this action, users will get rewards like coupons and discounts for shops, supermarkets and more.
If you want to know more about the first iteration, here's the link of a video showing how the app works.
